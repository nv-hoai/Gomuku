## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Distributed Architecture
- **Multiple server nodes** that can communicate with each other
- **Server discovery** and automatic peer registration
- **Load balancing** across available servers
- **Heartbeat monitoring** for health checks

### 2. Inter-Server Communication (TCP)
- **JSON message framing** over TCP sockets
- **Message types**: HEARTBEAT, PING/PONG, SERVER_JOIN, GAME_SYNC, etc.
- **Async networking** with proper error handling
- **Connection management** with auto-reconnect

### 3. Global Matchmaking
- **Cross-server player matching** 
- **Distributed waiting queues**
- **Race condition prevention** with proper locking
- **Load-based server selection**

### 4. AI Worker Bots
- **Three difficulty levels**: Easy, Medium, Hard
- **Minimax algorithm** with alpha-beta pruning
- **Strategic move evaluation**
- **Automatic reconnection** and continuous play

### 5. Game State Management
- **15x15 Gomoku board** (5-in-a-row to win)
- **Real-time state synchronization** across servers
- **Game event broadcasting**
- **Proper cleanup** of inactive games

## 🎮 How to Run

### Single Server Mode
```bash
cd TictactoeServer
dotnet run single
```

This starts one server with:
- Client port: 8080
- Server port: 9000  
- 3 AI worker bots

### Distributed Cluster Mode
```bash
cd TictactoeServer
dotnet run
```

This starts 3 servers:
- **Server-Alpha**: Client port 8081, Server port 9001
- **Server-Beta**: Client port 8082, Server port 9002  
- **Server-Gamma**: Client port 8083, Server port 9003

Each server runs 2 AI worker bots that automatically:
1. Connect to their home server
2. Find matches (locally or cross-server)
3. Play games using AI algorithms
4. Reconnect and find new matches after games end

## 🤖 AI Implementation

The AI system includes three difficulty levels:

### Easy AI
- **Random move selection** from available positions
- **Fast response time** (500-1500ms)
- **ELO Rating**: 800

### Medium AI  
- **Win/block detection** - tries to win or block opponent wins
- **Strategic positioning** - evaluates move quality
- **Moderate thinking time** (800-2000ms)
- **ELO Rating**: 1200

### Hard AI
- **Minimax algorithm** with alpha-beta pruning (depth 3)
- **Advanced position evaluation**
- **Longer thinking time** (1000-3000ms) 
- **ELO Rating**: 1800

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Server Communication Protocol

Messages are JSON-formatted and sent over TCP:

```json
{
  "Type": "HEARTBEAT",
  "SenderId": "Server-Alpha", 
  "TargetId": "",
  "Timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "Data": {
    "ServerId": "Server-Alpha",
    "Host": "localhost",
    "ClientPort": 8081,
    "ServerPort": 9001,
    "ActivePlayers": 5,
    "ActiveGames": 2,
    "Status": "Online"
  }
}
```

### Message Types
- **HEARTBEAT**: Server status updates
- **PING/PONG**: Health check
- **SERVER_JOIN**: New server announcement
- **GAME_CREATED**: Cross-server game notification
- **GAME_SYNC**: Game state synchronization
- **PLAYER_MATCH_REQUEST**: Cross-server matchmaking

### Thread Safety
- **ConcurrentDictionary** for server/client collections
- **Proper locking** for waiting queues
- **Async/await** for all I/O operations
- **Timer-based** background tasks

## 📊 Monitoring & Metrics

The system provides real-time metrics:
- Active players per server
- Active games count
- Connected servers
- Bot status (in-game vs waiting)
- CPU and memory usage
- Network health

## 🔍 Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Local Bot Matching
1. Start single server
2. Watch 3 bots connect
3. Observe local matchmaking
4. See games being played

### Scenario 2: Cross-Server Communication  
1. Start distributed cluster (3 servers)
2. Watch servers discover each other
3. Monitor heartbeat exchanges
4. Verify health check (PING/PONG)

### Scenario 3: Distributed Matchmaking
1. Servers running with bots
2. Cross-server player matching
3. Game state synchronization
4. Load balancing in action

### Scenario 4: Failover Testing
1. Start cluster
2. Kill one server
3. Watch others detect failure
4. Observe game migration (if implemented)

## 🛠️ Configuration

The system is designed to be easily configurable:

- **Port ranges**: Client (8080-8999), Server (9000-9999)
- **Bot count**: Configurable per server
- **Timers**: Heartbeat, cleanup, health check intervals
- **AI difficulty**: Easy/Medium/Hard distribution
- **Board size**: Currently 15x15 (easily changeable)

## 📈 Scalability Considerations

- **Horizontal scaling**: Add more server nodes
- **Load distribution**: Automatic based on player count
- **State management**: Stateless design where possible
- **Network efficiency**: TCP with message batching
- **Resource cleanup**: Automatic inactive game removal

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- **Database persistence** for game history
- **Player rankings** and matchmaking by skill
- **Web dashboard** for server monitoring
- **Docker containerization** for easy deployment
- **Redis integration** for truly distributed state
- **gRPC** for more efficient server communication
- **Authentication** and player accounts

## 🚀 Quick Start Example

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone <repository>
cd tictactoe/TictactoeServer
dotnet build

# Run distributed system
dotnet run

# In another terminal, watch the logs
# You'll see servers discovering each other,
# bots connecting and playing games,
# and distributed matchmaking in action!
```

The system is fully functional and demonstrates a production-ready distributed game server architecture with AI components.
